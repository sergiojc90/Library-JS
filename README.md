# Project: Library using JavaScript

Hi again! I'm glad to see you.

This is a simple JavaScript program that saves the information about the books you have read like the title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book.

The aim of the project is to gain better understanding of JS objects and prototypes, and of course, to implement this new knowledge in a web page using html and CSS.

I'm doing this project as a part of JavaScript Fullstack curriculum of [The Oding Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).
