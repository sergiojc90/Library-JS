# Project: Library using JavaScript

Hi again! I'm glad to see you.

This is a simple JavaScript program that saves the information about the books you are interested in. The information of the book that the app stores is the title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book.

The aim of the project is to gain better understanding of JS objects and prototypes, and of course, to implement this new knowledge in a web page using html and CSS.

I've done this project as a part of JavaScript Fullstack curriculum of [The Oding Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).

You are welcome to see the live version of the project [here](https://sergiojc90.github.io/Library-JS/).
